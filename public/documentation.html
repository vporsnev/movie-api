<h2>Achievement 2 Project: myFlix</h2>

<p>Objective To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application.
  The web  application will provide users with access to information about different  movies,
  directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their  personal information,
  and create a list of their favorite movies. </p>
